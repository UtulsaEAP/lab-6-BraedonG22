LAB: Check if list is sorted
Write the in_order() function, which has a list of integers as a parameter, and returns True if the integers are sorted (in order from low to high) or False otherwise. The program outputs "In order" if the list is sorted, or "Not in order" if the list is not sorted.

     Ex: If the  list passed to the in_order() function is [5, 6, 7, 8, 3], then the function returns False and the program outputs:

    Not in order

    Ex: If the list passed to the in_order() function is [5, 6, 7, 8, 10], then the function returns True and the program outputs:

    In order
Note: Use a for loop. DO NOT use sorted() or sort().
